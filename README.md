
**tui-java**

Small toolbox of old java stuffs circa 1998-2012.

It evolved as java evolved starting with `JDK1.1` and ending with `Java SE 8`. Most (if not all) of the functionality in these classes is available in Spring and/or later JDK releases. This is code archeology.

To build: `mvn clean install`

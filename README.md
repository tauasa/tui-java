
**tui-java**

Small toolbox of vanilla java stuffs I used for java development from 1998-2014. It evolved as java evolved starting with `JDK1.1` and ending with `Java SE 8`.

Originally compiled/packaged using bash, then Ant, and finally Maven (No pesky unit tests).

To build: `mvn clean install`

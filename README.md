
# **tui-java**

Toolbox of old java stuffs developed between 1998-2012.

It evolved as java evolved beginning with `JDK1.1` and active development ended with the release of `Java SE 8`. Most of the functionality in this library is available via Spring, Guice, and/or later JDK releases. 

This is essentially code archeology with 0.00 unit tests

I still use this code occasionally for rapid prototyping or quickly building simple web and CLI apps

To build: `mvn clean install`


**tui-java**

A toolbox of vanilla java stuffs I used for Java developed from 1998-2014. It evolved as Java evolved from `JDK1.1` to `Java SE 8`. 

Originally compiled with BASH, then Ant, and finally to Maven (requires Maven >= 3.1)

Like most java code from the early 2000's there are no pesky unit tests to deal with. 

To build:
>`mvn clean install`
